passing argument into select_seat             : its the way lambda works. Writing like this lets me get seat_number for each seat at button press. Further understand what lambda does


NOTE : If a seat is blocked or booked ie state is disabled it cannot be clicked, As such i do not need
       assign text to said seat since nothing from that seat ever needs to be passed into select_seat
